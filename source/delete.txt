Delete Documents
================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

From the :guilabel:`Documents` view, you can delete documents by
hovering over the document and selecting the trash icon:

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

The document is marked for deletion and Compass
asks for confirmation that you want to remove the document:

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

After you confirm, Compass deletes the document
from the collection.
