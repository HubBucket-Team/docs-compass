Types and Missing Fields
------------------------

|compass| displays the data types of fields in a collection's schema.
The example below reports that there are documents in the collection
that contain a field ``last_login`` with the type ``date``:

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

|compass| also displays a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In this example, 81% of documents store
``phone_no`` as a ``string``, and the remaining 19% store it as a
``number``:

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px

For sparse fields, where some documents omit a value, |compass| displays
the percentage of missing values as ``undefined``. Here, the ``age``
field is missing in 40% of the sampled documents.

Understanding Charts
--------------------

|compass| displays different charts for data fields depending on their
:term:`BSON type <bson types>`.

Strings
~~~~~~~

|compass| can display :term:`Strings <bson types>` in three different
ways. If all the documents in the collection have unique strings for a
given field, |compass| will display a random selection of string values.
Click on the refresh icon to generate a new set of random strings
sampled from the values for that field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-random-sample.png

If there are only a handful of unique string values, |compass| will
show the strings in a single graded bar, indicating the percentage
breakdown of string values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-percentage-breakdown.png

When there are many different string values with some duplication,
|compass| displays a histogram indicating the frequency of each string
found for that field. Hover the mouse on each histogram bar to see a
tool tip indicating the value of the string.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-histogram.png

Numbers
~~~~~~~

|compass| displays :term:`Numbers <bson types>` in a similar manner to
strings. A randomly-sampled subset of data is shown for an entirely
unique data set.

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-random-sample.png

For a data set of numbers containing duplicates, |compass| shows a
histogram to indicate value frequency.

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-histogram.png

Sub-documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|compass| displays :term:`Sub-document <document>` fields with a small
triangle next to the field name, along with some additional data.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument.png

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the sub-documents contained
within.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-expanded.png

Arrays
~~~~~~

|compass| displays fields containing an :term:`array <bson types>` with
the type distribution of the array's elements. A second type
distribution bar is displayed beneath the ``array`` type.

.. figure:: /images/compass/array-subtypes-array.png

Click on an array sub-type to view a chart of the data for that specific
type.

.. figure:: /images/compass/array-subtypes-boolean.png

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|compass| uses bar charts to represent :term:`dates <bson types>`. They
are also used for fields containing an :term:`ObjectID <objectid>`,
from which a date can be extracted.

The two charts on the top row visualize the date's data: the first is the day of
the week of the timestamp, and the second is the hour of day. The third chart in
the bottom row displays the range of timestamps: the earliest date, the most
recent date and the distribution of all timestamps in between.

.. figure:: /images/compass/dates-chart.png

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~

When Compass detects values that look like geographical coordinates, it
displays the data in a scatter plot. |compass| supports both
:term:`GeoJSON` documents and :term:`legacy coordinate pairs`.

Hover over points in the scatter plot with the mouse cursor to see a
tooltip displaying latitude and longitude coordinates.

.. figure:: /images/compass/coordinate-scatter-plot.png

Mixed Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

When a field has mixed types throughout a collection, you can change the
type of chart |compass| displays by clicking on a specific data type
underneath the field name.

As an example, this ``phone_no`` field is a mix of strings and numbers.
The chart displayed shows the values that are strings.

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-types-string.png

Click on the ``number`` data type to view the values that are numbers
instead.

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-types-number.png

Building Queries
----------------

There are two methods of building queries in Compass: automatic
generation with the query builder, or manual entry in the query bar.

Using the Query Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/compass-query-builder.rst

Manual Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the automatic query builder, queries can be manually
entered into the query bar. It is also possible to manually edit queries
built from the automatic query builder for further refining.

.. include:: /includes/steps/compass-manual-queries.rst

Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|compass| executes queries on the full collection. If the result set is
larger than the ``sampleSize`` threshold (100 documents), then |compass|
chooses a random subset of ``sampleSize`` documents from the result set
and to display in the UI.

Viewing Documents
-----------------

You can examine documents in the document viewing pane. You can expand
this pane by clicking on the Document Viewer icon on the right-hand side
of the page.

.. figure:: /images/compass/document-viewer-icon.png

By default, the pane displays all of the documents sampled by |compass|.
If a query is specified in the query bar, only documents that match the
query are shown.
