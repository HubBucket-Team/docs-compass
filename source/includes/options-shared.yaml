program: _shared
name: host
aliases: -h
args: <hostname><:port>
default: |
  localhost:27017
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :program:`mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     If you use IPv6 and use the ``<address>:<port>`` format, you must
     enclose the portion of an address and port combination in
     brackets (e.g. ``[<address>]``).
optional: false

program: _shared
name: username
aliases: -u
args: <username>
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a username with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
  that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--password`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.
optional: true

program: _shared

aliases: -p
args: <password>
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a password with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
  that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--username`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

     If you do not specify an argument for {{role}}, {{program}} returns
     an error.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.2

     If you wish {{program}} to prompt the user
     for the password, pass the :option:`--username` option without
     {{role}} or specify an empty string as the {{role}} value,
     as in ``--password ""`` .

optional: true

program: _shared
name: authenticationDatabase
args: <dbname>
directive: option
