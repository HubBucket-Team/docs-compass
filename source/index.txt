Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. :term:`Collections <collection>`
do not enforce a rigidly-defined :term:`document` structure and the
schema of a collection is not defined or available for inspection within
the database. MongoDB's flexible schema and rich document structure make
developers more productive, but they also make it difficult to explore
and understand the underlying data and its structure without first
executing queries in the shell against the database.

|compass| is a tool designed to allow users to easily analyze and
understand their schema within MongoDB without having to connect to a
shell or be familiar with the query syntax. It provides users with a
graphical view of their MongoDB schema by randomly sampling a subset of
documents from the entire collection. By sampling a subset of documents,
|compass| has minimal impact on the performance of the database and can
produce results to the user very quickly.

For more information on sampling, see the :ref:`compass-faq` section.
